# hi athena reviewers

this project went through several iterations, all of which can be accessed from the branches tab.

the original design sent to me didn't work out, because xyriiel's art is vertical and the website made was horizontal. there was originally going to be a carousel and all, but none of that went through in the end.

later on, I made the hover-flexbox layout, which is the one deployed on https://xyriiel-dev.angelcube.dev/.

currently, we're working on revamping it (again lmao), with the current figma looking like this:
